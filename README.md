# HA-robot

im trying to incorporate these files into my home assistant setup. ideally id like to be able to call the actions and the arduino will run the servos to perform 
set reactions. eg when a sensor triggers an alert the robot will bop and flash leds etc. 
im not sure of another better way of achieving this. running servos indiviadually using the servo integration on esphome and triggering it with automations wasnt v
very effecttive.
